## Overview

Take home challenge for [Wunder Werkz](https://www.iheartwunderwerkz.com/) - October 2022

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to showcase my front-end development skills and highlight my abilities in duplicating design specs and understanding legacy code.

## Approach

First, I went through the spec, style guide, and codebase thoroughly to gain a better understanding of how the data flowed through the app and what was perhaps attainable within the time frame of three hours. I created a [project board](https://github.com/users/mcfrann/projects/3) to organize my tasks and keep track of any issues, questions, or refactoring needs that came up throughout the project. I granted myself three hours over the span of a couple days to render the data to the page with roughly correct styling. I then granted myself some extra time on the last day to refactor and implement responsive design in the components I was able to finish so that what I had accomplished was buttoned up and ready for presentation. Finally, I updated my project board and deployed with Vercel.

## Technologies and Tools

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- HTML/JSX

## Install and Setup

To run this app locally:

1. Run `git clone git@github.com:mcfrann/ww-takehome.git` in your command line
2. Run `cd ww-takehome` to navigate into the repository
3. Run `npm install` - after this point, you will need an access token and id to continue. If you don't have access to those, feel free to check out the [deployed site](https://ww-takehome-francesca.vercel.app/).
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Up Next

Some tasks I would be eager to accomplish if I had more time would be to further familiarize myself with the SCSS variables (flex, etc) to utilize them more consistently throughout the app, fix the issues I had with the map showing up after breakpoints were added, dive into the parallax functionality, continue tweaking styling, and of course finish the app. :)
